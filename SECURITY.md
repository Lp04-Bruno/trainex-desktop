# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, contact the maintainer privately at:

- l.preusker@stud.phwt.de

Please include:

- a description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- impact assessment (what can be read/modified/executed)

This project currently has a single maintainer, so responses may take a little time, but I will reply as soon as possible.
